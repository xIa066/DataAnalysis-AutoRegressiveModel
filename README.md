# DataAnalysis-AutoRegressiveModel

This R program is an assignment question, simulate an underlying time series autoregressive, AR(p = 6), AR(p = 2)  process and fit it with models of p = 1...10. Then evaluate and analysis model criteria of all fits and calculated the probability of overfitting when sample size of the underlying process goes to infinity.
