# DataAnalysis-AutoRegressiveModel

This R program is an assignment question. It simulates an underlying time series autoregressive process, AR(p = 6), AR(p = 2) and fit it with models of p = 1...10. Then it evaluates all fits model based on 3 model criteria (IC1, IC2, IC3) and calculated the probability of overfitting when sample size of the underlying process goes to infinity.

Which I think it's an eligant hands-on example to learn how to choose models.

#### The analysis of the result can be found in the report in the repo, page 15, Question 3

#### The rest of the report includes practice questions on existing R datasets, related topics in single and multiple regression (Question 1) and ridget and lasso regression (Question 2)
